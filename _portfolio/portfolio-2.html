This project is done in collaboration with Cyber-Physical Systems Verification, Intelligence, Design and Analysis [(CPS-VIDA)](https://cps-vida.github.io/) lab at USC. In this project, we aim to come up with a framework for quantifying and improving robustness of agents trained in a specific way against adversarial agents. 
Keep an eye on our publications that will out soon.
